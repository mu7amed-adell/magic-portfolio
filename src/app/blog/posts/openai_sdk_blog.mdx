## Getting Started with OpenAI SDK

The OpenAI SDK provides a clean, type-safe interface for integrating GPT models into your applications. Whether you're building chatbots, content generators, or AI assistants, the SDK handles authentication, request formatting, and response parsing.

    codes={[
      {
        code:
`import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

async function generateContent(prompt) {
  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
      { role: "user", content: prompt }
    ],
    max_tokens: 150,
    temperature: 0.7,
  });
  
  return completion.choices[0].message.content;
}`,

      }
    ]}
/>

## Key Features and Capabilities

**Chat Completions**: Build conversational interfaces with context-aware responses and role-based message handling.

**Function Calling**: Enable AI models to trigger specific functions in your application, creating dynamic and interactive experiences.

**Streaming Responses**: Implement real-time AI interactions with token-by-token streaming for better user experience.

          }
        }
      }
    ]
  });
  
  return assistant;
}`,

## Error Handling and Rate Limiting

Production applications require robust error handling and rate limiting strategies. The SDK provides built-in retry mechanisms and detailed error information.

## Performance Optimization

Cache frequent requests, implement request batching, and use appropriate model selection to optimize both performance and costs. Consider using fine-tuned models for specialized tasks to improve accuracy and reduce token usage.

The SDK's flexibility allows for sophisticated prompt engineering techniques, including few-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting for complex reasoning tasks.
