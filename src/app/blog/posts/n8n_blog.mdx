## What is n8n?

n8n is an open-source workflow automation tool that allows you to connect different services, APIs, and databases through a visual interface. Think of it as the plumbing between your favorite tools, enabling them to work together seamlessly.

## Why n8n for AI Workflows?

The beauty of n8n lies in its ability to orchestrate complex AI workflows without writing extensive code. You can connect OpenAI's GPT models, process data from databases, send notifications, and trigger actions based on AI responses - all through a drag-and-drop interface.
